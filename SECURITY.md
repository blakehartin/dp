## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability.

Reach out in [Discord](https://discord.gg/bbbMPyzJTM) for disclosing a vulnerability. Do not disclose directly in the channel, but inform that you have a vulnerability to share and then wait for DM from one of the members/devs.
